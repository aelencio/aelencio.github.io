        <summary>My Childhood</summary>
        I was born during the winter of 1998 in Montevideo City. It is a small but beautiful city which I miss.
        I really can't remember if it was a happy childhood; I remeber feeling awful sometimes, and I guess somtimes I was happy, but what I clearly remember was being angry, like, <span class="angry">all</span> the time.
